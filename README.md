# TalentScout ‚Äì AI Hiring Assistant

## Overview
TalentScout is a Streamlit-based AI chatbot that screens candidates by collecting personal details and generating a practical technical question based on their tech stack using an LLM (Groq API). The chatbot provides a conversational interface for gathering candidate information and dynamically generates a relevant technical interview question.

## Features
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Uses Groq API for natural language processing
- üìù **Step-by-Step Data Collection**: Collects candidate information systematically
- üîç **Input Validation**: Validates email, phone, experience, and other fields
- üéØ **Dynamic Question Generation**: Creates a scenario-based technical question tailored to the declared tech stack
- üíæ **Session State Management**: Maintains conversation context using Streamlit session state
- üõë **Conversation End Detection**: Gracefully ends the chat when the candidate completes the process or uses an exit keyword

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Groq API key (sign up at [groq.com](https://groq.com))

### Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API Key**
   - Open `utils.py`
   - Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual Groq API key
   ```python
   GROQ_API_KEY = 'your-actual-api-key-here'
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## Conversation Flow

1. **Greeting**  
   The chatbot greets the candidate and explains the process.

2. **Information Gathering**  
   The chatbot collects:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Phone Number (with country code)
   - Years of Experience
   - Desired Position(s)
   - Current Location
   - Tech Stack (comma-separated)

3. **Technical Question Generation**  
   After collecting the tech stack, the chatbot generates one practical, scenario-based technical question relevant to the candidate's declared technologies.

4. **Answer Collection**  
   The candidate answers the technical question or can type "skip" to move on.

5. **End Conversation**  
   The chatbot thanks the candidate and informs them that the team will get back to them via the provided email or phone.

## Prompt Design

- **System Context**:  
  The chatbot maintains a professional, friendly tone, collects information efficiently, and generates one relevant technical question.
- **Greeting Prompt**:  
  Welcomes candidates, explains the process, and sets expectations.
- **Technical Question Prompt**:  
  Generates a single scenario-based question tailored to the candidate's tech stack.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **API Integration**:  
  Robust error handling and fallback responses for Groq API failures.
- **Input Validation**:  
  Comprehensive validation for email, phone, experience, and name using regex and logical checks.
- **Session State Management**:  
  Uses Streamlit's session_state to persist chat history, candidate data, and step progression.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**:  
  Flexible prompt templates for generating contextual scenario-based questions.
